# Enter www.montevideo.com, which is the website of Montevideo Portal
# In the "search" bar, enter the word "marihuana"
# A number of news that contain either in the title, in the subtitle or in the body the word "marihuana" appear
# A number is also generated, where you can see the number of pages that contain the word "marihuana"
# The first page for the searched word is https://www.montevideo.com.uy/anbuscador.aspx?1,1,marihuana,1,,0
# The pattern between the pages is that 1 is added to the number after "marihuana,"
# Ask ChatGPT to generate a list of URLs that add up to 167, to have the 167 URLs
# Use this prompt: "Generate a list of 167 URLs, with the base "https://www.montevideo.com.uy/anbuscador.aspx?1,1,%C2%A0marihuana,1,,0", that changes the number after "marihuana," from 1 to 167"
# Paste that list in a sheet in Google Sheets
# Use the formula =TRANSPOSE(A1:A167) to change all the URLs into columns, instead of rows
# In a row below the first URL, write the XPath "//h2[@class='title']" 
# Drag it to the left until all URLs have an Xpath underneath it
# One row below, write down the formula =IMPORTXML(B1,B2) 
# Now, all the news titles will start appearing
# Remember to copy and paste as value only the results, so that the sheet does not overflows with requests
# In a row way down repeat this same last steps but changing the XPath for "//h4"
# Now, all the dates of the news will start appearing
